It is a game where we have to guess the correct word in a limited guess .

code :

import random

#we have some word list
#words=["SURAJ","LOVE","LAPTOP","DESKTOP"]

f=open("dictionaryWord.txt","r")
data=f.readline()
words=data.split(e)

word=random.choice(words)
word=word.upper()
total_chance=4
print("You have total chances of ",total_chance,"to guess the word .")
guessed_word="-"*len(word)

while total_chance!=0:

    print(guessed_word)
    letter=input("Guessed letter : ").upper()
    if letter in word:

        for index in range(len(word)):

            if word[index]==letter:

                guessed_word=guessed_word[:index]+letter+guessed_word[index+1:]
                
        if guessed_word==word:

            print("Congratulation ! You won .")
            break
    else:
        total_chance=total_chance-1
        print("Incorrect guess :")
        print("Remaining chances are :",total_chance)

else:
    print("Game Over !!! ")
    print("You lose the game .")
    print("All chances are exusted .")
print("The Correct word is :",word)
